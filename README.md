# About.
These are configuration files I use on Mac and Linux systems,
which have been largely inspired by other people.

# Installation.

Use [bootstrap.sh][bootstrap.sh] to symlink all of the dotfiles
in this repo to the home directory and install vim plugins.

```Bash
git clone --recursive git://github.com/bamos/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

[bootstrap.sh]: https://github.com/bamos/dotfiles/blob/master/bootstrap.sh
